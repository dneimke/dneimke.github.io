            <p>Building new dotnet core projects on VSTS requires hosting your own build agent.<p>

            <ul>
                <li>Targeting the new MSBuild format requires MSBuild v15.</li>
                <li>You can find v15 in the following folder if you have the latest version of VS installed:
                    <kbd>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\MSBuild\15.0\Bin</kbd></li>
                <li>MSBuild v15 is not installed on the Hosted Build Agent on Visual Studio Team Services (<abbr title=" Visual Studio Team Services">VSTS</abbr>)</li>
                <li>To build the new formatted projects on <abbr title=" Visual Studio Team Services">VSTS</abbr>, you will need
                    to use a hosted build agent</li>

        <h2>Serendipity <small>aka Trial and Error</small></h2>

        <p>
            Below is a list of steps that I followed while trying to get MSBuild v15 format building on
            <abbr title=" Visual Studio Team Services">VSTS</abbr>.
        </p>

        <p>Firstly I ensured that the solution would build in my VS2017 IDE</p>

        <img src="/aspnet_msbuild/2017-01-14_18-45-41.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded" alt="Build from within VS2017" />

        <p>I was able to verify the the solution built.</p>

        <img src="/aspnet_msbuild/2017-01-14_18-46-19.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded" alt="Build from within VS2017" />

        <p>Run MSBuild from root folder of my project.  I had MSBuild on my PATH at the following address: 
            <kbd>C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\Bin</kbd>
        </p>

        <img src="/aspnet_msbuild/2017-01-14_18-47-02.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded" alt="Build from within VS2017" />

        <p>Errors abound!</p>

        <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span>
            <span class="sr-only">Error:</span> 
            C:\src\...\PerformanceAnalyst.Web.csproj(1,1): error MSB4041: The default
 XML namespace of the project must be the MSBuild XML namespace. If the project is authored in the MSBuild 2003 format,
 please add xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003" to the &lt;Project> element. If the project has be
en authored in the old 1.0 or 1.2 format, please convert it to MSBuild 2003 format.
        </div>

        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/digory/status/820153681978880001">I enquired on Twitter</a>, and
        was given advice that I needed to use MSBuild 15</p> 

        <p>After adding the VS2017 folder to my PATH variable (<kbd>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\MSBuild\15.0\Bin</kbd>), I opened a new console and re-ran MSBuild</p>

        <img src="/aspnet_msbuild/success.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded" alt="Success!" />

        <p>Success! The solution is now using MSBuild v15 to build the project successfully on my local machine</p>

        <p>Next task was to push my code and configure a build task in VSTS.  I chose the 'out of the box' build definition for building Visual Studio
                Solutions which comes with a set of pre-configured tasks for building and testing code.
        </p>

        <img src="/aspnet_msbuild/ootb_build_definition.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded" alt="OOTB VS Build Definition" />

        <p>I queued a new build and waited patiently for it to complete.  Fail!</p>

        <img src="/aspnet_msbuild/vsts_fail.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded" alt="vsts build failure errors" />

        <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span>
            <span class="sr-only">Error:</span> 
PerformanceAnalyst.Core\PerformanceAnalyst.Core.csproj (1, 1)
PerformanceAnalyst.Core\PerformanceAnalyst.Core.csproj(1,1): Error MSB4041: The default XML namespace of the project must be the MSBuild XML namespace.

If the project has been authored in the old 1.0 or 1.2 format, please convert it to MSBuild 2003 format.
        </div>

        <p>My conclusion was that the build agent did not have MSBuild v15 installed.  I hunted around and found 
            a different MSBuild Task which allowed more fine-grained control over MSBuild and which listed MSBuild 15
            as an option.
        </p>

        <p>
            I queued a new build... Fail!
        </p>

Visual Studio version '15.0' not found. Looking for the latest version.
        </div>
        
        <p>After failing I decided to track down <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/news/2016">the release notes for VSTS</a> to see what software is installed.  It was at this 
            point that I discovered that MSBuild 15 is not installed yet and, to continue, I would need to host and configure my own build agent.
            </p>

        <img src="/aspnet_msbuild/must_use_custom_build_agent.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded" alt="custom build agent" />

        <p>The next option was to look at doing a build using the dotnet CLI.  To use the dotnet CLI for MSBuild projects,  
            <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/cli/blob/rel/1.0.0/Documentation/ProjectJsonToCSProj.md">requires .NET CLI preview 3
            or greater</a>.  The current .NET CLI version is <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/cli">CLI Preview 4</a> which you can get from 
            <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/preview4-download.md">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>After installing Preview 4 on my machine, I confirmed that I was able to build my solution using <code>dotnet build</code> command.</p>

         <p>While not confident, I thought it would be worth double-checking to see what version of the .NET CLI is installed on the VSTS 
             Hosted Build Agent.  Sure enough, Preview 2 is the version that is currently installed - which works against project.json 
             based projects.</p>

        <img src="/aspnet_msbuild/dotnetcli_command.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded" alt="Preview 2" /> 

        <p>At this point I see it is clear that, to continue with cutting edge .NET Core development will require me to setup my own build agent!</p>

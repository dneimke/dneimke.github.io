                The topic for this article is how to design data in Firestore when working with associated collections so that it is efficient
                to retrieve and easy to work with for CRUD data operations.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the purpose of this article, we will assume that we are working with User documents which have a relationship to a collection
                of Cart documents. The article will discuss 3 design alternatives for modeling the data and look at the pros
                and cons for each design.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Option A
                <small>Nest carts under a user</small>
            </h2>

            <p>The following example shows carts nested under a user.</p>

            <pre>
/users/
{
    "1": {
        "firstName": "Darren",
        "lastName": "Neimke",
        "carts": [
            "a76h32": {
                ...
            },
            "9iP7dR": {
                ...
            },
            "Mkl54d": {
                ...
            }
        ]
    } 
}
        </pre>

            <p>
                This design makes it easy to
                <code>retrieve</code>,
                <code>update</code>, and
                <code>delete</code> the carts for a user. However,
                <a href='https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/structure-data' target='_blank'>as discussed in the Firestore docs</a>, every request of a
                <code>User</code> will result in the cart data also being returned with the payload.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another consideration for this approach is that it makes retrieving individual carts for difficult as you need the Id of
                both the user and the cart in order to locate the cart document.
            </p>

            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>
                Refer to the following sample to see example code for working with this style of lists:

            <h2>Option B
                <small>Store carts in their own collection</small>
            </h2>

            <p>
                The following example shows carts stored in their own collection with a userId property.
            </p>

            <pre>
/users/
{
    "1": {
        "firstName": "Darren",
        "lastName": "Neimke"
    } 
}

/carts/
{
    "a76h32": {
        "userId": "1",
        ...
    },
    "9iP7dR": {
        "userId": "1",
        ...
    },
    "Mkl54d": {
        "userId": "2",

}

            <h2>Option C

            </h2>

            <p>
                The following example shows carts stored in their own collection and a reference to the user carts under the user.
            </p>

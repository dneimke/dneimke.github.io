                The topic for this article is how to design data in Firestore when working with associated collections so that it is efficient
                to retrieve and easy to work with for CRUD data operations.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the purpose of this article, we will assume that we are working with User documents which have a relationship to a collection
                of Cart documents. The article will discuss 3 design alternatives for modeling the data and look at the pros
                and cons for each design.

            <h2>Approach A
                <small>Nest carts under a user</small>
            </h2>

            <p>The following example shows carts nested under a user.</p>

            <pre>
/users/
{
    "1": {
        "firstName": "Darren",
        "lastName": "Neimke",
        "carts": [
            "a76h32": {
                ...
            },
            "9iP7dR": {
                ...
            },
            "Mkl54d": {
                ...
            }
        ]
    } 
}
        </pre>
            <h3>Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                In order to
                <code>retrieve</code>,
                <code>update</code>, and
                <code>delete</code> the carts using this design, you will first need to know the Id of the owner user.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have a reference to the items and the user, updating them
                <code>updating</code> or
                <code>deleting</code> them is relatively straightforward as you are working with an Id and a
                <code>DocumentReference</code> at that point.</p>
            <p>
                <a href='https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/structure-data' target='_blank'>As discussed </a> in the Firestore docs, every request of a
                <code>User</code> will result in the cart data also being returned with the payload.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, this approach makes retrieving individual carts difficult as you need the Id of both the user and the cart in order
                to locate the cart document. So it would be difficult to rely solely on this approach if you wanted to have
                the ability to share carts with others.
            </p>

            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href='https://fire-playground-1d37c.firebaseapp.com/nested-collection'>Nested Collections</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Approach B
                <small>Store carts in their own collection</small>
            </h2>

            <p>
                The following example shows carts stored in their own collection with a userId property.
            </p>

            <pre>
/users/
{
    "1": {
        "firstName": "Darren",
        "lastName": "Neimke"
    } 
}

/carts/
{
    "a76h32": {
        "userId": "1",
        ...
    },
    "9iP7dR": {
        "userId": "1",
        ...
    },
    "Mkl54d": {
        "userId": "2",
        ...
    } 
}
        </pre>

        </section>


        <section>
            <h2>Option C
                <small>Store carts in their own collection - and a reference to the Cart under the user</small>
            </h2>

            <p>
                The following example shows carts stored in their own collection and a reference to the user carts under the user.
            </p>

            <pre>

    <h1><span id="f-harden">James</span><span id="l-harden"> Harden</span></h1>
    <p>James Harden is a professional basketball player and he plays for the Houston Rockets. His first ever team was the Oklahoma City Thunder(or OKC for short)
    but then OKC had to trade Harden because they didnt have enough cap space to resign Harden. The reason they couldn't resign Harden is because of Kendrik 
    Perkins massive contract. The Thunder didn't have enough money to resign Harden on the max contract and thats all that Harden wanted, so rather than keeping a 
    dynasty they traded him to the Rockets where he has become the best shooting guard in the league.</p><p> Harden was the 3rd pick in the 2009 NBA draft.
    Some interesting facts about Harden are that he went to Arizona College, Harden didn't have a beard when he first got into the NBA and Hardens idol is Manu 
    Ginobli.
